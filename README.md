# mofa-nft-cards
The 'mofa-nft-cards' project is the envisioned image asset repository for the NFT project 'mofa' In the mofa NFT project, we consider magical abilities as the primary assets. 

## Magical Abilities

This project serves as a repository for showcasing early visual explorations in the direction of magic cards. At this stage, our design concept involves building magic based on different series, such as lightning, chaos energy, ice, among others. However, we have not yet finalized the determination of the series and the specific magic within each series. The following list outlines each magic card corresponding to its magic series and characteristics.
